# Personal C++ Library
I have begun writing my own library of containers and other utilities for my own personal use.

# Why?
The C++ standard library is all well and good, but there comes a time where implementing commonly used features
yourself serves as a valuable learning exercise.

# Disclaimer
This library is at a very early stage of development, The aim is to expand and refine what is here based on the needs of any person projects that are being worked on at the time.
